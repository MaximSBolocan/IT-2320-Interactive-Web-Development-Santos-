<p class="Pharagraph" >Hello my name is Max,this page has no scripts, has no picture and has no information. 
The code itself is very Ugly, but i wrote it about 4 months ago and since then I never came back to it, and 
now I'm using it for my first Assignment.I had a problem with the script from first page,i tried to use one class for both buttons,but 
i had problems,thats why i had to write 
two diferent scripts and two different classes for each button. Update I foud the solution for the buttons.
